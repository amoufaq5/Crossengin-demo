# Ship as App — CrossEngin operator manual (R50, ADR-0109)

This document walks a new operator from a fresh checkout to a running
CrossEngin JSON-RPC daemon serving live requests.

CrossEngin ships as a **local daemon + client** pair. The daemon
(`crossengin-rpc-daemon`) binds a TCP socket and serves 12 stable
verbs. Any client that can speak line-oriented JSON over TCP can
drive it — `curl`, `nc`, a shell script, a native app, a browser
extension. The reference client is `scripts/rpc.sh`.

The design lives in [`ADR-0109 Ship as App`](adr/0109-ship-as-app.md).
The wire is documented in [`ADR-0104 §Component 5`](adr/0104-nl-surface.md).

## 1. Prerequisites

- Linux, macOS, or Windows (via WSL for the launcher scripts;
  the daemon binary itself runs native Windows via
  `make cross-windows`)
- A working NOVA toolchain at `$NOVA_ROOT` (default `~/NOVA`).
  See [`docs/GETTING_STARTED.md`](GETTING_STARTED.md) for the
  NOVA install.
- `bash`, `printf`, `nc` (or Bash 4+ with `/dev/tcp` support) —
  present on every modern Unix. No Python, Node, jq, or Docker
  required.

## 2. Build

From the repo root:

```bash
make install
```

Builds every implemented entry point into `./bin/`:

```
bin/crossengin                 (unified cognitive daemon, existing)
bin/crossengin-chat            (interactive REPL, existing)
bin/crossengin-rpc-daemon      (JSON-RPC daemon, new in R49)
bin/crossengin-selfcheck       (substrate self-check)
bin/crossengin-spine           (companion-spine demo)
bin/crossengin-kg-publisher    (kg_sync publisher, existing)
bin/crossengin-kg-subscriber   (kg_sync subscriber, existing)
bin/crossengin-fed-coordinator (federation coordinator, existing)
```

Cross-compile for Windows:

```bash
make cross-windows
# produces bin/*.exe including bin/crossengin-rpc-daemon.exe
```

## 3. Boot the daemon

```bash
scripts/rpc_daemon.sh
```

Defaults: loopback `127.0.0.1`, port `9876`. Override with env:

```bash
CE_RPC_PORT=19876                     scripts/rpc_daemon.sh
CE_RPC_BIND=192.168.1.10 \
  CE_RPC_BIND_ALLOW_NON_LOOPBACK=1    scripts/rpc_daemon.sh
```

The launcher refuses to bind non-loopback without the explicit
`CE_RPC_BIND_ALLOW_NON_LOOPBACK=1` flag. **Do not flip that flag on a
network you don't fully control** — the RPC wire executes named
skills, so exposing it is roughly equivalent to opening a
shell-command port. TLS on the RPC socket is deferred to R54
(sandbox architecture, ADR-0105); until then, treat non-loopback
as "SSH tunnel only" or wrap in a `stunnel`.

Expected output:

```
=== CrossEngin JSON-RPC daemon ===
binary: ./bin/crossengin-rpc-daemon
endpoint: 127.0.0.1:9876
hit with:  scripts/rpc.sh <verb> '<args-json>'
example:   scripts/rpc.sh nl.ask '{"text":"what is mars","user_id":"owner"}'

=== CrossEngin JSON-RPC (line-oriented; one JSON request per line; 12 verbs; envelope {ok, result, error}; ADR-0104) ===
listening on 127.0.0.1:9876  (max_request=65536 bytes)
```

## 4. Preload the reference skills

In another terminal:

```bash
scripts/preload.sh
```

Installs the reference skills (`echo`, `research`) so `nl.ask` works
on the first request. Output:

```
=== CrossEngin preload (daemon at 127.0.0.1:9876) ===
  install skill: echo                       OK
  install skill: research                   OK

  daemon inventory:
    KGs      : {"ok":true,"result":["world"],"error":""}
    skills   : {"ok":true,"result":[...],"error":""}
    capsules : {"ok":true,"result":[],"error":""}
preload done.
```

## 5. Hit the wire

```bash
# Parse-only debug (LLM-free grammar, deterministic):
scripts/rpc.sh nl.parse_only '{"text":"is earth a planet"}'
```

```json
{"ok":true,"result":{"kind":"is-a","raw_text":"is earth a planet","parser_used":"grammar","args":["earth","planet"]},"error":""}
```

```bash
# Full end-to-end (parse + skill run + templater):
scripts/rpc.sh nl.ask '{"text":"what is mars","user_id":"owner"}'
```

The `result` contains a full ExecutionResult including the templated
English answer with source citations, plus the underlying atoms and
persona projection for auditability.

```bash
# Pretty-print with jq:
CE_RPC_JQ=1 scripts/rpc.sh nl.ask '{"text":"what is mars","user_id":"owner"}'
```

## 6. Verify the ship-as-app promise

The five things that make CrossEngin different from an LLM chatbot,
verifiable via the wire:

| Property | Verify |
|---|---|
| **Auditable parse** | `nl.parse_only` returns the exact StructuredQuery |
| **Source-cited answers** | `nl.ask` result includes `atoms[]` with `[kg, label, belief]` per source |
| **LLM-free reasoning path** | Daemon prints no LLM calls; `parser_used` is `"grammar"` |
| **Persona is advise-only** | `persona.project` returns raw `valence_shift`/`risk_score`, never overrides |
| **Effectors described, not executed** | `nl.ask` result's `proposal.effector_calls[]` names planned actions; nothing dispatches |

## 7. The 12 verbs at a glance

| Verb | Args | Returns |
|---|---|---|
| `nl.ask` | `{text, user_id}` | full ExecutionResult with templated English answer |
| `nl.parse_only` | `{text}` | StructuredQuery only (for debugging what the grammar saw) |
| `kg.list` | `{}` | list of KG label names |
| `capsule.list` | `{}` | list of `{name, version, installed}` |
| `capsule.install` | `{name}` | `{name, code, installed}` |
| `skill.list` | `{}` | list of `{name, version, description, installed}` |
| `skill.run` | `{name, arg}` | ProposalResult (proposal, atoms, effector_calls, projection, trace) |
| `persona.show` | `{user_id}` | full persona record (OCEAN, emotion, risk, counts) |
| `persona.project` | `{user_id, proposal}` | Projection (valence_shift, arousal_shift, risk_score, similar/pref counts) |
| `ingest.review` | `{}` | review-queue entries |
| `ingest.approve` | `{id}` | approve status |
| `ingest.deny` | `{id, reason}` | deny status |

Wire envelope for every response:

```json
{"ok": true, "result": <verb-specific>, "error": ""}
{"ok": false, "result": null, "error": "..."}
```

Requests may carry an optional `"id"` field (number, string, or null)
that the daemon echoes verbatim for client-side correlation.

## 8. Interactive REPL (existing, still works)

Power users and operators can keep the chat REPL:

```bash
./bin/crossengin-chat
```

The REPL and the daemon are **independent processes** — they do not
share KGs, personas, or skill installs unless you explicitly wire a
shared snapshot (see `/save` / `/load` in the chat REPL). Run either;
run both if you like.

## 9. Docker (recipe, not shipped)

The `Dockerfile` needed for a container image is small: a base with
the NOVA toolchain, `make install`, `EXPOSE 9876`, `CMD
["./bin/crossengin-rpc-daemon"]`. Not shipped as a signed image
because R50's story is source-first; a hobbyist can compose one in
five lines.

## 10. Systemd / launchd / Windows service

Not shipped in R50. The daemon binary is a plain foreground process
that speaks JSON-over-TCP; wrapping it as a system service is
distribution-specific. A minimal systemd unit:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=CrossEngin JSON-RPC daemon
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/opt/crossengin/bin/crossengin-rpc-daemon
Environment=CE_RPC_PORT=9876
Environment=CE_RPC_BIND=127.0.0.1
Restart=on-failure
User=crossengin

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Similar shape for launchd or a Windows service.

## 11. Snapshot round-trip

The chat REPL writes / reads durable snapshots (`/save`, `/load`).
The RPC daemon does NOT yet expose these via the wire (deferred to
R51+ under `session.save` / `session.load` verbs). For now, chat and
daemon are separate processes with their own in-memory state.

## 12. What comes next (R51+)

- **R51** — Web UI: a minimal SPA that hits the daemon via a
  WebSocket-to-TCP shim; renders templated answers with citations
- **R52** — Style Capsules (ADR-0108 implementation)
- **R53** — Pattern Capsules (ADR-0107 implementation)
- **R54** — Sandbox architecture (ADR-0105): capability separation,
  TLS on RPC, user-signed skill install
- **R55** — Multi-user daemon: session slots per user, per-session
  DP accounting, snapshot round-trip via wire

## 13. Troubleshooting

- **`bind failed on 127.0.0.1:9876`** — another daemon is running on
  that port. Kill it (`ss -ltnp | grep 9876`) or set `CE_RPC_PORT`
  to another port.
- **`socket() failed`** — the runtime doesn't allow socket creation
  (containers with restrictive seccomp filters can hit this). Run
  outside the container or relax the filter.
- **`no response from 127.0.0.1:9876`** — the daemon crashed or
  never started. Check its stderr; look for a `bind failed` or
  compile-time error.
- **`unknown verb: X`** — you typed the verb wrong. Spell it exactly
  as in section 7 above. `scripts/rpc.sh` prints the list on
  argument-count errors.
- **`no ingest agent in context`** on `ingest.*` — the standalone
  daemon does NOT wire the ingestion pipeline (R49 design). Use the
  chat REPL's `/ingest` for authored packs; the daemon will pick
  them up once R55 wires shared snapshots.

## Appendix: security posture

- **Loopback default.** The daemon binds `127.0.0.1` unless
  overridden. Any non-loopback bind requires an explicit
  `CE_RPC_BIND_ALLOW_NON_LOOPBACK=1` flag.
- **No auth on the wire.** The R49 daemon assumes the socket itself
  is the auth boundary. Anyone who can `nc` your port can dispatch
  named skills. This is correct for local-first / single-user; it
  is NOT correct for a LAN-exposed or public deployment. Sandbox /
  TLS / capability tokens land in R54.
- **No sandboxing on skill execution.** Skills run in the same
  process as the daemon. A malicious skill install is equivalent to
  a code-execution vulnerability. Only install skills you trust or
  wrote yourself until R54.
- **Persona is READ-ONLY through the wire.** `persona.show` reads;
  `persona.project` reads. No wire verb mutates a persona (mutations
  go through the chat REPL's `/persona set ...` commands, which have
  their own audit trail).
